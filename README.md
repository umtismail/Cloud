# Air Quality Analysis
This project aims to analyse air quality data obtained from the OpenAQ API on AWS. The process involves retrieving air quality data from the OpenAQ website using their API, cleaning and organising the data, tagging it into categories such as 'good', 'moderate' and 'unhealthy', analysing the data using SQL queries with Athena and finally creating a dashboard using QuickSight.

# Project Overview
The project follows the following steps:

Data Collection: Air quality data is retrieved from the OpenAQ API. Data Cleaning and Labelling: The received data is cleaned, organised and assigned labels such as 'good', 'moderate' and 'unhealthy' according to air quality standards. Data Analysis: ATHENA and SQL queries are used to perform in-depth analyses on the data and obtain valuable information. Dashboard Creation: A dashboard with various visualisations such as pie charts, world maps, etc. is created using Quicksight to present the analysed data in an easily understandable format.
